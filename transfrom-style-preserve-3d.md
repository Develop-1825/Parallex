The `transform-style: preserve-3d;` property in CSS is used in conjunction with 3D transformations to control how child elements are rendered in 3D space. Specifically, it determines whether the child elements of a transformed element should be rendered in 3D (preserving their 3D position) or flattened into the plane of their parent element.

### Key Points:

1. **Preserve 3D**:

   - When you set `transform-style: preserve-3d;` on a parent element, any 3D transformations (like `translateZ`, `rotateX`, `rotateY`, etc.) applied to the child elements are preserved. This means that the child elements will appear in 3D space relative to the parent, maintaining their 3D depth and positioning.
   - The 3D effect is more noticeable and realistic because the children are not flattened into the 2D plane of the parent.

2. **Flattening Without `preserve-3d`**:

   - By default, or if you set `transform-style: flat;`, the 3D child elements are flattened onto the 2D plane of their parent. This means that any 3D transformations applied to the children will be ignored or rendered as if they were in 2D space, removing the depth effect.

3. **Usage Scenario**:
   - `transform-style: preserve-3d;` is particularly useful when you want to create complex 3D scenes where elements need to be positioned in 3D space relative to one another. It allows child elements to maintain their 3D transformations even when the parent element is transformed.

### Example:

Hereâ€™s an example to illustrate `transform-style: preserve-3d;`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <style>
      .container {
        width: 200px;
        height: 200px;
        transform-style: preserve-3d;
        transform: rotateY(20deg);
        perspective: 600px;
        position: relative;
        margin: 100px auto;
        border: 1px solid #ccc;
      }

      .box1,
      .box2 {
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
        position: absolute;
        top: 50px;
      }

      .box1 {
        background-color: lightblue;
        transform: translateZ(-50px); /* Moves this box 50px back */
      }

      .box2 {
        background-color: coral;
        transform: translateZ(50px); /* Moves this box 50px forward */
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="box1"></div>
      <div class="box2"></div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Breakdown of the Example:

1. **`.container` with `transform-style: preserve-3d;`**:

   - The `.container` element is set to `transform-style: preserve-3d;`, which means that the 3D transformations applied to its child elements (`.box1` and `.box2`) are preserved in 3D space.
   - The container itself is rotated along the Y-axis by 20 degrees (`transform: rotateY(20deg);`), which allows you to see the 3D positioning of its children more clearly.

2. **Child Elements with 3D Transforms**:

   - **`.box1`**: This box is moved backward along the Z-axis by 50px (`transform: translateZ(-50px);`). It appears further back in the 3D space.
   - **`.box2`**: This box is moved forward along the Z-axis by 50px (`transform: translateZ(50px);`). It appears closer in the 3D space.

3. **Effect of `preserve-3d`**:

   - Because `transform-style: preserve-3d;` is applied to the `.container`, the two boxes appear at different depths, and the rotation of the container makes this 3D effect visible. The boxes maintain their 3D positioning relative to each other and the parent.

4. **If `transform-style: flat;` Were Used Instead**:
   - If you replaced `preserve-3d` with `flat`, the child elements (`.box1` and `.box2`) would be flattened into the plane of the container, losing their 3D depth. They would overlap without any noticeable depth difference, and the 3D transformations would not be visible.

### Key Takeaway:

- **`transform-style: preserve-3d;`** is crucial for maintaining the 3D transformations of child elements within a transformed parent. It ensures that these children are rendered in 3D space, giving a realistic depth effect when combined with properties like `perspective` and 3D transforms (`rotateX`, `rotateY`, `translateZ`, etc.).
